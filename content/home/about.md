I am a computational biologist interested in gene regulation, cancer (epi)genomic, and chromatin regulatory dynamics of tumor growth.

I did my PhD in Bioinformatics at Tsinghua University, China with [Prof. Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/xuegonglab/index.html) followed by a three year Postdoc at NCMM, University of Oslo, Norway with [Dr. Anthony Mathelier](https://mathelierlab.com/). During PhD and postdoctoral training my primary research emphasis was on regulatory genomics and epigenomics. I developed computational methods, tools, and resources to understand the (epi)genomic control of gene regulation in development and disease.

Currently in [Dr. Christina Curtis’s lab](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) at the Stanford Cancer Institute where I develop reproducible pipelines and computational methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics data at bulk and single-cell resolution to understand tumor evolution and chromatin regulatory dynamics of tumor growth.

Apart from research, I advocate for open science, open source, preprints, reproducibility in research and often [tweet](https://twitter.com/khanaziz84) about it. I am a contributor for [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and also developed several open source tools and resources such as [JASPAR](http://jaspar.genereg.net/) and [ECRcentral](https://ecrcentral.org/).
